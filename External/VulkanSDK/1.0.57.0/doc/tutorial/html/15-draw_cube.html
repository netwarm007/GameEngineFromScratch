<p>Code file for this section is <code>15-draw_cube.cpp</code></p>

<p>You're almost done!</p>

<p>Here are the final steps needed to get your Vulkan image up onto the screen:</p>

<h2>Waiting for a Swapchain Buffer</h2>

<p>Before starting to draw anything, the sample program needs a target swapchain
image to render into.
The <code>vkAcquireNextImageKHR()</code> function is used to get an index into the
swapchain image list, so it knows which framebuffer to use as a rendering target.
This is the next image that is available for rendering.</p>

<pre><code>res = vkCreateSemaphore(info.device, &amp;imageAcquiredSemaphoreCreateInfo,
                        NULL, &amp;imageAcquiredSemaphore);

// Get the index of the next available swapchain image:
res = vkAcquireNextImageKHR(info.device, info.swap_chain, UINT64_MAX,
                            imageAcquiredSemaphore, VK_NULL_HANDLE,
                            &amp;info.current_buffer);
</code></pre>

<p>For the first frame, using the semaphore is <em>probably</em> not needed because
all the images in the swapchain are probably available.
But it is still good practice to make sure that the image is ready before proceeding
with the actual submission of commands to the GPU, which we do a bit later.
And if this sample were changed to render multiple frames, as in an animation,
then it becomes necessary to wait until the hardware is finished with an image before
using it again.</p>

<p>Note that you are not waiting for anything <em>now</em>.
You are just creating this semaphore and associating it with the image so that
the semaphore can be used to postpone the submission of the command buffer until
the image is ready.</p>

<h2>Beginning the Render Pass</h2>

<p>You have already defined the render pass in a previous section, so
starting the render pass by putting a begin render pass command in the
command buffer is straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>VkRenderPassBeginInfo rp_begin;
rp_begin.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_RENDER_PASS_BEGIN_INFO;
rp_begin.pNext = NULL;
rp_begin.renderPass = info.render_pass;
rp_begin.framebuffer = info.framebuffers[info.current_buffer];
rp_begin.renderArea.offset.x = 0;
rp_begin.renderArea.offset.y = 0;
rp_begin.renderArea.extent.width = info.width;
rp_begin.renderArea.extent.height = info.height;
rp_begin.clearValueCount = 2;
rp_begin.pClearValues = clear_values;
vkCmdBeginRenderPass(info.cmd, &amp;rp_begin, VK_SUBPASS_CONTENTS_INLINE);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you already created a command buffer and put it in recording mode by calling
<code>init_command_buffer()</code> and <code>execute_begin_command()</code> earlier in this sample.</p>

<p>You supply the previously-defined render pass and the framebuffer selected by the
index returned from <code>vkAcquireNextImageKHR()</code>.</p>

<p>The clear values were initialized to set the background color to a very dark grey and the
depth buffer to its "far" value (<code>clear_values</code>).</p>

<p>The rest of the needed information is in <code>info.render_pass</code> as you set up before, and you then
go ahead and insert this command to start the render pass into the command buffer.</p>

<h2>Bind the Pipeline</h2>

<p>Next bind the pipeline to the command buffer with:</p>

<pre><code>vkCmdBindPipeline(info.cmd, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, info.pipeline);
</code></pre>

<p>You defined the pipeline in the previous section and binding it here tells the GPU
how to render the graphics primitives that are coming later.</p>

<p><code>VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS</code> tells the GPU that this is a graphics pipeline
instead of a compute pipeline.</p>

<p>Note that since this command is a command buffer command, it is possible for a program
to define several graphics pipelines and switch between them in a single command buffer.</p>

<h2>Bind the Descriptor Sets</h2>

<p>Recall that the descriptor set we defined earlier described how the shader program
expects to find its input data, such as the MVP transform.
Give that information to the GPU here:</p>

<pre><code>vkCmdBindDescriptorSets(info.cmd, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS,
                        info.pipeline_layout, 0, 1,
                        info.desc_set.data(), 0, NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>Again note that you could bind different descriptors in the middle of a command buffer
if you wanted to change how the shader program finds its data.
For example you could use a different descriptor to point to a different MVP transform
if you wanted to change the transform in the middle of a command buffer.</p>

<h2>Bind the Vertex Buffer</h2>

<p>You created a vertex buffer and filled it with vertex data back in the vertex_buffer sample.
Here, tell the GPU how to find it:</p>

<pre><code>const VkDeviceSize offsets[1] = {0};
vkCmdBindVertexBuffers(info.cmd, 0, 1, &amp;info.vertex_buffer.buf, offsets);
</code></pre>

<p>This command binds the vertex buffer or buffers to the command buffer.
In this case, you bind only one buffer, but it could be used to bind many.</p>

<h2>Set the Viewport and Scissors Rectangle</h2>

<p>You indicated earlier that the viewport and scissors were states that are dynamic,
which means that they can be set with a command buffer command.
So, you need to set them here.
Here's the code in <code>init_viewports()</code> that sets the viewport:</p>

<pre><code>info.viewport.height = (float)info.height;
info.viewport.width = (float)info.width;
info.viewport.minDepth = (float)0.0f;
info.viewport.maxDepth = (float)1.0f;
info.viewport.x = 0;
info.viewport.y = 0;
vkCmdSetViewport(info.cmd, 0, NUM_VIEWPORTS, &amp;info.viewport);
</code></pre>

<p>The code for the scissors rectangle is similar.</p>

<p>It is probably good to make these dynamic because many applications need to change
these values if the window changes in size during execution.
This avoids having to rebuild the pipeline when the window size changes.</p>

<h2>Draw the Vertices</h2>

<p>Finally, issue a draw command to tell the GPU to send the vertices into the pipeline
and finish the render pass.</p>

<pre><code>vkCmdDraw(info.cmd, 12 * 3, 1, 0, 0);
vkCmdEndRenderPass(info.cmd);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>vkCmdDraw</code> command tells the GPU to draw the 36 vertices once.
You already configured the primitive assembly part of the pipeline to draw a list of
independent triangles, so this means drawing 12 triangles.</p>

<p>The <code>vkCmdEndRenderPass</code> command signals the end of the render pass,
but the command buffer is still "open" and the sample is not finished recording commands.</p>

<h2>Transitioning the Swapchain Image for Presenting</h2>

<p>While the GPU is rendering, the target swapchain image layout is
<code>VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL</code>,
which is the best layout for the GPU rendering.
You set this layout in the subpass definition when you defined the render pass
in a previous section of this tutorial.
But this layout may not be the best layout for the display hardware that scans the image out to the
display device.
For example, the optimum GPU memory layout for rendering might be "tiled",
as discussed in the render_pass section of this tutorial.
But the display hardware may prefer a linear memory layout for scanning out the memory to the
display hardware.
You use the <code>VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR</code> layout to specify that the image is about to
be presented to the display.</p>

<p>You already took care of this layout transition in the render pass section by
specifying the <code>finalLayout</code> as <code>VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR</code> in the
description of the color image attachment:</p>

<pre><code>VkAttachmentDescription attachments[2];
attachments[0].format = info.format;
attachments[0].samples = NUM_SAMPLES;
attachments[0].loadOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR;
attachments[0].storeOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE;
attachments[0].stencilLoadOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE;
attachments[0].stencilStoreOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE;
attachments[0].initialLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED;
attachments[0].finalLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR;
attachments[0].flags = 0;
</code></pre>

<h3>Memory barrier approach</h3>

<p>Note that there is another way to accomplish this layout transition by recording another
memory barrier command in the command buffer.
This alternate approach may be useful in certain cases, such as in queue
submissions that do not use a render pass.
An example of this situation can be found in the <code>copy_blit_image</code> sample, which is
not part of this tutorial, but can be found in the same folder as these
tutorial samples.</p>

<p>In this sample, you are using a render pass, but you can still use this alternate approach
if you leave the <code>finalLayout</code> for the color attachment the same as <code>initialLayout</code>
in the render_pass sample where you create the render pass:</p>

<pre><code>attachments[0].initialLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL;
attachments[0].finalLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL;
</code></pre>

<p>This then requires you to perform this transition with another pipeline memory barrier,
in much the same way the <code>set_image_layout()</code> performs layout transitions:</p>

<pre><code>VkImageMemoryBarrier prePresentBarrier = {};
prePresentBarrier.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_MEMORY_BARRIER;
prePresentBarrier.pNext = NULL;
prePresentBarrier.srcAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT;
prePresentBarrier.dstAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_MEMORY_READ_BIT;
prePresentBarrier.oldLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL;
prePresentBarrier.newLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR;
prePresentBarrier.srcQueueFamilyIndex = VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED;
prePresentBarrier.dstQueueFamilyIndex = VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED;
prePresentBarrier.subresourceRange.aspectMask = VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT;
prePresentBarrier.subresourceRange.baseMipLevel = 0;
prePresentBarrier.subresourceRange.levelCount = 1;
prePresentBarrier.subresourceRange.baseArrayLayer = 0;
prePresentBarrier.subresourceRange.layerCount = 1;
prePresentBarrier.image = info.buffers[info.current_buffer].image;
vkCmdPipelineBarrier(info.cmd, VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT,
                     VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_BOTTOM_OF_PIPE_BIT, 0, 0, NULL, 0,
                     NULL, 1, &amp;prePresentBarrier);
</code></pre>

<p>The above code is not in this sample, but can be found in the <code>copy_blit_image</code>
sample.</p>

<p>Once this command executes after the end of the render pass,
the image buffer is ready to display.
And of course, you do not need to transition the depth buffer image layout.</p>

<h2>Submit the Command Buffer</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that you have not actually sent any commands to the GPU yet.
You have just recorded them into the command buffer.
But now you are done recording:</p>

<pre><code>res = vkEndCommandBuffer(info.cmd);
</code></pre>

<p>You need to create a fence, which you use to tell when the GPU is done.
You need to know when the GPU is done so that you don't start the
present to the display too soon.</p>

<pre><code>VkFenceCreateInfo fenceInfo;
VkFence drawFence;
fenceInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_FENCE_CREATE_INFO;
fenceInfo.pNext = NULL;
fenceInfo.flags = 0;
vkCreateFence(info.device, &amp;fenceInfo, NULL, &amp;drawFence);
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can submit the command buffer:</p>

<pre><code>const VkCommandBuffer cmd_bufs[] = {info.cmd};
VkPipelineStageFlags pipe_stage_flags =
    VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_BOTTOM_OF_PIPE_BIT;
VkSubmitInfo submit_info[1] = {};
submit_info[0].pNext = NULL;
submit_info[0].sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SUBMIT_INFO;
submit_info[0].waitSemaphoreCount = 1;
submit_info[0].pWaitSemaphores = &amp;imageAcquiredSemaphore;
submit_info[0].pWaitDstStageMask = &amp;pipe_stage_flags;
submit_info[0].commandBufferCount = 1;
submit_info[0].pCommandBuffers = cmd_bufs;
submit_info[0].signalSemaphoreCount = 0;
submit_info[0].pSignalSemaphores = NULL;
res = vkQueueSubmit(info.queue, 1, submit_info, drawFence);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_BOTTOM_OF_PIPE_BIT</code> is the final stage in the pipeline where the commands
finish execution.</p>

<p>The <code>imageAcquiredSemaphore</code> is used to wait until the image is ready before drawing,
as explained at the top of this section.
This makes the driver wait on the <code>imageAcquiredSemaphore</code> to know that the swapchain
image is available.
Then it submits the commands to the GPU.
When the GPU is done executing the commands, it signals the fence <code>drawFence</code> to
indicate that the drawing is complete.</p>

<h2>Wait for Command Buffer to Complete</h2>

<p><code>vkWaitForFences()</code> waits for the command buffer to complete execution.
It is called in a loop here in case the commands take much longer to complete
than expected, which should not be the case in this simple sample.</p>

<pre><code>do {
    res = vkWaitForFences(info.device, 1, &amp;drawFence, VK_TRUE, FENCE_TIMEOUT);
} while (res == VK_TIMEOUT);
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you know that the swapchain image buffer is ready to present to the display.</p>

<h2>Present the Swapchain Buffer to Display</h2>

<p>Presenting the swapchain image to the display is straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>VkPresentInfoKHR present;
present.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PRESENT_INFO_KHR;
present.pNext = NULL;
present.swapchainCount = 1;
present.pSwapchains = &amp;info.swap_chain;
present.pImageIndices = &amp;info.current_buffer;
present.pWaitSemaphores = NULL;
present.waitSemaphoreCount = 0;
present.pResults = NULL;
res = vkQueuePresentKHR(info.queue, &amp;present);
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you should now see a cube on the screen!</p>
